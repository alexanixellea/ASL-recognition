# ASL-recognition
This project attempts to bridge the gap between the deaf community and the hearing community. Although there exists many different technologies for transcribing voice to text, there only exists a few technologies for interpreting ASL to text. Those solutions are fairly expensive. This solution is inexpensive (one can find a leap for for $25) and open source. Furthermore, we use classical lingusitic theory of sign language to describe different signs.
# Setup
To setup this ASL-recognition, you must obtain the leap motion SDK and opencv 2.4.12. You can get the leap SDK at [https://developer.leapmotion.com/get-started](https://developer.leapmotion.com/get-started) and the opencv sdk at [http://opencv.org/downloads.html](http://opencv.org/downloads.html). You must have at least java 1.7.79. If you have any questions regarding setup, feel free to email me at npw3202@rit.edu
# Running
You can run this program by running the executable jar file ASL-recognition.jar (in the root directory).
# Architecture
The architecture of this program is quite unique.
